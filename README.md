### REACT & Firebase

#### Rick and Morty Trading-Cards
> This is a simple project about fetching data with React from firebase</br>
> The exercise in this project was:</br>
>> Fetch Data</br>
>> Use a status </br>
>> Handle Errors </br>
>> Use React Error Boundary </br>
>> Use ResetKeys </br>

#### useState vs. useReducer
> - When it's just an independent element of state you're managing:   useState  
> - When one element of your state relies on the value of another element of your state in order to update:   useReducer
#### Firebase
> In the Utils Folder, you will find all files related to Firebase</br>
>> There is a tradingCards_DATA.js file for Firestore db in case you want to create your own.</br>
>> The current configuration in the firebase.utils file works though.</br>

#### React APP
> Run the app from the main folder - npm start</br>
> Will run on localhost:3000</br>

#### Credit
> I want to give credit to **Kent C. Dodds** </br>
> I got the idea to this project from one of Kent C. Dodds exercises in his Epic-React Course.</br>
> I took his exercise and turned it completly around and put Firestore behind it.</br> 
> You can find more information about Epic-React here:</br>
